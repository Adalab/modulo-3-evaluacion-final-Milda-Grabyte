# Rick and Morty Character Database

This is the final test for React module (Adalab, 2020).
This is a character search engine for **Rick and Morty** series, developed with :electron:, JS, HTML, SASS and very thin patience (last module... you get me).

The following functionalities have been implemented:

- [x] Fetching data from API
- [x] Rendering an _alphabetically sorted_ character list (cards) with each character's\
      · foto\
      · name\
      · species\
      · dead/alive status
- [x] Filtering characters by search input and _showing alerts_ in case of no match
- [x] Search can be done both in capital and lower case characters
- [x] Clickable cards link to a detailed single character description page. _Use of React Router_. New added info:
      · gender\
      · origin\
      · total episode count
- [x] The detail page links back to the homepage and the input value is preserved in _LocalStorage_
- [x] Form default submit action prevented 
- [x] _Responsive, mobile-first_ design
- [x] Use of grid and flex
- [x] Use of images and emoticons in character info
- [x] _Shareable links_ and an alert when trying to access a non.existing detailed info page
- [x] Favicon
- [x] A few animations and external links for better user experience

I hope you enjoy the searching experience, brought to you by a Front-end junior! :blush::computer::octocat::beers:
